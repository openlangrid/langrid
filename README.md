Language Grid is an infrastructure for accumulating and sharing language Web services. Resources with complicated intellectual property issues are wrapped as language Web services and shared on the Language Grid, which includes the following libraries.

* API library that enables developers to invoke language services which have been shared on Language Grid.
* API library that enables developers to develop new language services by combining language services on Language Grid. 
* API library that enables developers to develop language web service from existing language resources.

# Join Language Grid
Language Grid users can use or publish language services via Language Grid.
To register Language Grid as its user, please follow the instruction described in following URL.
Joininig the Language Grid: http://langrid.org/operation/en/procedure.html

# Invoke Language Services
Language Grid users can develop language applications by using language services registered on Language Grid.
The API libraries for invoking language services on Language Grid have been published on the following URL.
* Language Grid Multilingual Studio: http://langrid.org/developer/jp/

To use this API, the User ID and Password of Language Grid are required. These are issued when the registration of Language Grid. 
It also requires WSDL information of language services. (Please refer to tutorial of Multilingual Studio: http://langrid.org/developer/jp/phplibrary_tutorial.html)

# Develop Language Services
Language Grid users can develop langauge services by using own langauge resources or softwares (We call it "Wrapping").
To wrap langauge services, please refer to the following manual.
* Language Service Creation Manual: https://sourceforge.net/projects/servicegrid/files/Language%20Grid/language-service-creation-20110711-ja.pdf/download

Wrapped services which are deployed on web server can be registered on Language Grid Service Manager.
Please refer to the following manual.
